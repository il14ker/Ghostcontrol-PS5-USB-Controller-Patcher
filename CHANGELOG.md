# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Release tags use semver (`1.0.x`).

## [1.0.5] — 2026-07-05

### Added

- **8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless (81HD)** in XInput mode (`2dc8:310a`), including USB-C and 2.4G dongle ([PR #19](https://github.com/StonedModder/Ghostcontrol-PS5-USB-Controller-Patcher/pull/19), thanks @AdailtonSilva88).
- Reuses the existing Manba XUSB 20-byte report parser; device-specific USB endpoints IN `0x84` / OUT `0x05`.
- **`Supported_controllers.md`** — organized compatibility matrix linked from the README.

### Fixed

- **Probe ordering:** `2dc8:310a` is matched by VID:PID before the generic XInput interface branch, preventing mis-normalization to Manba `045e:028e` and wrong endpoint opens.
